This page introduces a standard to help you make your learning management system (LMS) and other authoring tools accessible to people with disabilities. This includes students and end users, and also accessibility for educators, and course administrators.

It includes quotes from personas (fictional users) to help you understand some aspects of accessibility specific to your tools.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Your current customers and potential new customers need learning management systems (LMS) that:
* are accessible to instrictors with disabiliies
* produce accessible content for students

In many situations, accessibility is required by law.

## Examples _(@@ examples below to be revised based on EOWG input... hopefully by Jade :-)_

### Make your Tool Accessible for Users with Disabilities

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>Lisa is a physics professor at a large university. She is blind and uses a screen reader that reads the information on her screen aloud.</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>I need to create accessible materials for my students and to do this, the tool needs to be accessible to me too. Some LMSs don't work very well or at all with my screen reader. For example, if I can't use a built-in editor, I can't preview or upload content within the tool.</q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>Other LMSs enable me to create accessible resource materials and assignments. I can preview the results all within the tool. I can also track students progress and grade their assignments because the tool is designed to work well with my screen reader.</q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

The tool itself should be accessible to instructors who have auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Users with disabilities need to be able to use your tool to do everything that users without disabilities do.

### Enhance navigation and editing via content structure/Provide text search of the content (this title needs editing)

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>John is a high school administrator. He uses speech recognition software and uses his voice to navigate through systems and websites.</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>I need to be able to search courses and attendance lists quickly if I have course administration to complete. Some LMSs don't support assistive technology users, so I have a hard time using them. I sometimes need to use third-party software for certain areas of work which aren't accessible to me on the LMS.</q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>Other LMSs are set up correctly with clearly structured content which I can search through easily to find the information I need.</q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Users have different ways of interacting with websites, systems, and digital content and might use a range of assistive technology. When your tool supports this and is set up correctly, it enables all users to interact with your LMS successfully, not just students or end users. 

### Authors are supported in improving the accessibility of existing content (this title needs editing)

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>Ivan is a learning/instructional designer at an online university.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>Some LMSs don't show me where there are existing accessibility issues in our courses or guide me so I can fix them quickly and easily and put an effective process in place</q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>Other LMSs guide me to fix potential accessibility issues by automatically flagging them before they're live. Creating accessible content is much easier when it's indicated like this.</q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Your tool needs to be able to produce accessible content. This includes:

* ensuring any automatically-generated content is accessible
* helping authors fix potential accessibility issues.

Accessible LMS make it easier for learning/instructional designers to create accessible content.

### Promote accessibility features

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>Jenny is the director of a language school and looks after a number of instructors who teach online. She is new to accessibility.</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>Some LMSs don't document their accessibility features. It is hard to see and understand where teachers can make their content accessible easily, and also monitor which teachers are producing accessible materials for students.</q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>Other LMSs are very well documented for accessibility. I have been able to get started very easily and pick up what to do quite quickly. This is useful so we can demonstrate that our courses at the school are accessible.</q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Promote the accessibility features of your tool. For example, you can document how to produce accessible content. When your tool actively promotes the creation of accessible content, it helps those who are new to accessibility as well as encouraging authors to create accessible content.

## The Accessibility Standard to Help You

Your learning management system (LMS) is an 'authoring tool'.

There is an international standard to help you meet accessibility needs: **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)**. ATAG is developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](/WAI/)).

Use ATAG to help make your tool:
* accessible to educators and course administrators with disabilities [Part A]
* support accessible content for students [Part B]

For example, ATAG covers the above examples:
* @@ revised wording of examples above &mdash; @@ wording from ATAG at a Glance [@@B3]
* Make your Tool Accessible for Users with Disabilities &mdash; Make the authoring tool user interface accessible
* Support alternatives to images and multimedia &mdash; Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content
* Ensure your tool produces accessible content &mdash; Authors are supported in producing accessible content
* Promote accessibility features &mdash; Authoring tools promote and integrate their accessibility features

To get started putting ATAG to work for you, see:
* [[ATAG Overview]](/standards-guidelines/atag/), with links to the ATAG standard and implementing ATAG
* [[ATAG at a Glance]](/standards-guidelines/atag/glance/), a paraphrased summary to give you an idea of what's covered in ATAG
